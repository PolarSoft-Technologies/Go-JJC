# Go-JJC
 A boilerplate for Go projects, which covers the basics of setting up a server with Golang. This repo covers server routing in a more professional way as well as database setup/connections for MongoDB, MySQL, MariaDB, GraphQL, FireBase etc. This project is free to use and maintained by PolarSoft Technologies. Support from like-minded Go developers is highly appreciated
