# Go-JJC
A boilerplate for **Go** projects, which covers the basics of setting up a server with **Golang**. This repo covers server routing in a more professional way as well as database setup/connections for **MongoDB, MySQL, MariaDB, GraphQL, FireBase** etc. This project is free to use and maintained by PolarSoft Technologies. Support from like-minded Go developers and correctional help is highly appreciated.

**NOTE:**
This project uses **<a href="https://docs.gofiber.io/">Fiber</a>** which is an **Express** inspired web framework built on top of Fasthttp, the fastest HTTP engine for Go. Designed to ease things up for fast development with zero memory allocation and performance in mind.

Basically, if you want to learn how to use **Go** as your backend and you are coming from a **NodeJs** background using **Express.js**, then this repo is for you! It handles and represent to you the usage of Express-like **NodeJs** setup in a **Go** way, while being rigorious but yet simple to read and understand.

Also, for those who don't have any knowledge of Express in NodeJs, you will definitely love **Go-JJC** for its simplicity and super fast ability to power your APIs/server/backend effectively!
